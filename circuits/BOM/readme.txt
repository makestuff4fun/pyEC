You can find detailed BOMs here. I have done my best to include all info needed to source these parts. 
I have used as many generic components as possible. Note the 2*25 Pin header 1.0mm pitch is not very common. I only found one supplier

I buy 100P and cut them down to 50P. Gives 1 50P + 1 48P. I have a lot of 48P headers if anyone wants them :P
