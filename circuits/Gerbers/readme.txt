You can generate your own Gerber files from the most updated PCB layout from CircuitMaker. 
These Gerber files are provided for reference only and may not be compatible with your PCB production company.
Please verify units etc. before sending out any files for production. I have produced these boards at JLC PCB with no issues,
but please verify for yourself.
