kelly.py communicates with Kelly controllers. I have only tested with KLS-S controllers but I suspect the data return format is similar on all their controllers. I will need to verify this at some point.

The controller has 3 blocks of data you can read, 3A, 3B & 3C. 
send_3A()

Requests data block A
        
send_3B()

Requests data block B

send_3C()

Requests data block C

get_data()

The reads the serial buffer and parses the data into variables you can then read from main.
split the calls to send_3X and get_data to give the kelly time to respond. Max rate is 15 blocks of data per second. 
I haven't found anything useful in block C, I only read blocks A & B.
