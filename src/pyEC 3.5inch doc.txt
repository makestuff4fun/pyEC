File created with TJC USART HMI 0.59. Software is free to download from:
http://tjcfile.iicp.net:885/USARTHMI/hmi.rar

Reasonable work around.
1. Download and install TJC sfotware.
2. Downlod and extract Nextion software, don't use the installer

Now you can run both software at the same time. Copy and paste code between them and see what the
Chinese fields mean. Not ideal, but easier than learning to read Chinese :)

This is a development version of my current software. It has pages I don't use, a new spedometer that works but flashes. 
It has overlapping graphics that can't work the way I'd like. Other pages are partial implementations of menus. I think it's the
best to see as it has the most resources to use. Password screen, menus, timers etc.
