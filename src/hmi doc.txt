debug(msg, arg='', arg2='', arg3='')

Provides a way to output data to the console. It's easily disabled by commenting out the print line.

write_raw(message)

Output text to the hmi serial port

write_message(message)

Encodes message to ISO-8859-1
Adds trailing 0xFF,0xFF,0xFF to message, then calls write_raw()

set(key, value)

Sets a key or setting on the HMI

set_page(id)

Sets the current page to display on the HMI

set_value(id, value)

Sets the value of a variable on the HMI

set_text(id, value)

Sets a text string value in the HMI

read_return()

Reads the return value, used in obtaining variable values from the HMI
This function is typically called by process_return if there is serial data waiting on HMI serial port. There really no need to call it directly


process_return()

Processes different types of data for the HMI and calls appropriate handler.

process_standard_return()

Orignally a quick way to log errors from HMI function calls.
Due to limitations of the HMI, it can't be used to get success/failure messages from the HMI as the delay causes errors in the main loop.
It functions properly, but conditional behavior based on failure of a command is not practical. Messages can be rerieved as they arrive with very little delay, but they may be hard to associate with specific function call.
Currently it's not used.

set_page_by_name(page_name)

Set HMI page by page name.

get_page()

Have HMI return the current page

get(name)

Get HMI setting

get_value(id)

Get value of variable from HMI

get_text(id)

Get text string variable from HMI

add(id, channel, value)

Add a value to a plot

addt(id=1, channel=0, num_bytes=5, buff=None)

Bulk add data to a plot, good for loading logs for display

clear_graph(id=1)

Clears a plot

debug_message(str)

Activates my debug HMI page for showing errors on HMI. Must have supporting HMI code

update_volts(new_volts)

Update my HMI voltage display. Must have supporting HMI code

update_motor_temp(new_motor_temp)

Update my HMI motor temp display. Must have supporting HMI code

update_amps(new_amps)

Update my HMI phase amps display. Must have supporting HMI code

update_speed(new_speed)

Update my HMI Speed display. Must have supporting HMI code

update_page()

Uses the current page of the HMI to determine what data to send. This must be configured for your HMI code

update_graph()

Updates plot with voltage etc. Must have supporting HMI code
